### About:

This repository is dedicated to the development of a system called Alapha Automations. Our developers push updates from this repository to the virtual private server (VPS) that Alpha Authority owns. This repository alone is considered by our developers to be a bot, and not the whole system which our VPS runs with. We may not always keep this bot open to the public, so what you see here might be the last sight you see at any given time.

Feel free to look through this, we've done a lot to reset and remove old tokens and keys that were found in this project. So far, what is here is secure and maybe not effiicient friendly, but it works good enough.
